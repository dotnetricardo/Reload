# Reload
A Visual Studio extension for web developers that automatically syncs browsers with source file changes.

# Instructions
Reload is very simplistic, it's goal is to automaticallu refresh your development browser(s) everytime there are changes in a file once <strong>CTRL + S</strong> is pressed on the IDE. 

Once installed you will see the Reload menu option in the Visual Studio toolbar. Just select the browser(s) you want to sync with file changes and also select which file extensions to watch for.

Currently only Chrome, Firefox and IE are supported.
 
That's is nothing else.
